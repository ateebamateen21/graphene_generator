# graphene_generator

Nanomaterials have evolved as one of the most potential contributors in water
treatment in the last two decades. Nanomaterials like carbon nanotubes (CNTs), boron nitride
nanotubes (BNTs), and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are some examples of
nanomaterials which have proved their potential in water treatment as either adsorbents or
membranes. One such example is the application of graphene sheets in water treatment both
as adsorbent and reverse osmosis membrane because of their 2D structure which is more
simplified as compared to CNTs, BNTs, and MOFs. Graphene sheets are repeated benzene
rings like a honeycomb structure. Prior to testing of graphene sheets in the laboratory as
adsorbents, a simulation is required. As a first step of the simulation, it is required to generate
the graphene sheet structure. As an expert python programmer, your expertise are required to
generate the graphene sheet of any size in terms of required number of benzene rings in x and
y dimensions. As an example, figure below shows a small graphene sheet with eight benzene
rings in x-direction and eight benzene rings in y-direction.

Job Description
Your job is two write a generalized python function to generate a sybyl mol2 structure of
graphene sheet (using Python’s I/O operations) of user defined number of rings in x and ydirections. The structure generated using your written function must be visualizable with any
supported visualization software. As an example, the function may look like the one shown
below.
graphene_generator(x_rings, y_rings)
The following command will generate a graphene structure shown in Figure 1 upon
visualization in a supported molecular visualization software.
graphene_generator(8, 8)
The bond length between any two directly bonded carbon atoms is 1.4 Å.
Bounds
Use only math package.
